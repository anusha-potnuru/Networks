 If the file is present, the server first sends a message “​L​” followed by an integer ​FSIZE indicating the size of the file. The client receives this message and waits for the file data to be received in blocks.
6. The server divides the file in a predefined block size ​B which is an integer. ​B is known to both the server and the client a priori. Assume, ​B = 20 bytes. Note that if the file size is FSIZE​, then there will be (F​ SIZE/B​) (integer division) number of blocks of size ​B and the last block will be of size (​FSIZE % B​) (remainder operation) bytes. Every ​send() call for file transfer sends data not more than that of a single block to the client.
7. With every ​recv() call, the client receives the message block exactly of size ​B bytes except for the last block. With reception of every blocks, it maintains a running count of the number of blocks received, and accordingly calculates the size of the last block. For the last block, it waits for exactly ​(FSIZE % B)​ bytes.
8. As the client receives data in blocks, it copies the same into a new file in the local directory. Once the client has received all the blocks, it closes the connection and exits.
9. Note that no special end of file marker is sent to the client. Client understands the end of file transfer from the number of bytes received.dasd
