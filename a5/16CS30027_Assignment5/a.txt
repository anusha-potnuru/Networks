The overall protocol is mostly similar to the one that you did in Assignment 2 for file transfer over a stream socket, except that here the transfer will be through fixed sized blocks. Your task will be to write two programs - one program corresponding to the server process and another program corresponding to the client process. The client process requests for the content of a file (by providing the file name) and the server process sends the contents of that file to the client. The file is a text file of arbitrary size. The transfer of the contents of the file works using a communication protocol as follows.
