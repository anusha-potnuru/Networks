port ​Y – ​this must be the first command sent to the server​. Y is the port number of the data port at which the client waits. If any other command is sent as the first command, the server sends an error code 503, closes the connection, and returns to wait on socket S1. If the server receives it properly (checks that Y is between 1024 and 65535), it sends a reply code 200. Otherwise it sends an error code 550, closes the connection, and returns to wait on socket S1. If the client receives any error code from the server, it closes all connections and exits.
