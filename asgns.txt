What is meant by “network byte order”? I don’t think it’s very well defined.
 I think it refers to the fact that a variety of network things use MSB order, 
 including Ethernet frames and IPv4 packets. Presumably, we have to convert our numbers to MSB order 
 because the kernel wants to copy them byte-for-byte into the IP packet.
